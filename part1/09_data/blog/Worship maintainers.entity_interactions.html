<strong>Technology</strong> has had a <strong>cult</strong> of <strong>newness</strong> for centuries. We hail <strong>innovators</strong>, <strong>cheer change</strong>, and <strong>fend</strong> off <strong>critics</strong> who might think new and change are coming too fast. Unfortunately, while that <strong>drives</strong> the <strong>cycle</strong> of <strong>creation</strong>, it also creates <strong>biases</strong> that <strong>damage</strong> what we create, reducing the <strong>benefits</strong> and increasing the costs. Formerly new <strong>things</strong> rapidly become ordinary "<strong>plumbing</strong>," while <strong>maintenance</strong> becomes a <strong>cost center</strong>, something to complain about. "Green <strong>fields</strong>" and <strong>startups</strong> look ever more attractive because they offer <strong>opportunities</strong> to start fresh, with minimal <strong>connections</strong> to past <strong>technology</strong> decisions. The <strong>problem</strong>, though, is that most of these new <strong>things</strong> — the <strong>ones</strong> that succeed enough to stay around — have a long maintenance cycle ahead of them. As <strong>Axel Rauschmayer</strong> put it:
"<strong>People</strong> who <strong>maintain stuff</strong> are the unsung <strong>heroes</strong> of software development." In a different <strong>context</strong>, <strong>Steve Hendricks</strong> of <strong>Historic Doors</strong> pointed out that:
"<strong>Low</strong> <strong>maintenance</strong> is the holy grail of our culture. We've gone so far that we're willing to throw things away rather than fix them." That gets especially expensive. Heaping <strong>praise</strong> on the <strong>creators</strong> of new <strong>things</strong> while trying to minimize the <strong>costs</strong> of the <strong>maintainers</strong> is a <strong>recipe</strong> for <strong>disaster</strong> over the long term. more
I've contributed to this disaster. I love starting new <strong>projects</strong> on open <strong>fields</strong>, full of <strong>visions</strong> for creating from scratch. I can choose my own <strong>tools</strong>, <strong>tackle</strong> <strong>problems</strong> from the <strong>angles</strong> I prefer, and, perhaps most important, choose the <strong>order</strong> in which I add new features. In the <strong>books</strong> I write, I assume the <strong>reader</strong> is starting from <strong>scratch</strong>, able to learn <strong>features</strong> in <strong>isolation</strong> and slowly develop a <strong>sense</strong> of how it all fits together. Even as I've spent <strong>years</strong> telling the <strong>story</strong> of starting from a clean <strong>slate</strong>, though, I've spent most of my <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>Web</strong> <strong>time</strong> on <strong>maintenance</strong>, updating my own and other <strong>people</strong>'s <strong>content</strong>, <strong>code</strong>, <strong>servers</strong>, and networks. <strong>Maintenance</strong> constantly calls me out of my <strong>comfort zone</strong>, forcing me to remember <strong>things</strong> I did long ago or focus on parts that used to just work. <strong>Maintenance</strong> <strong>forces</strong> me to rely on other <strong>people</strong> — the real <strong>heroes</strong> — on a regular <strong>basis</strong>, often in <strong>emergency</strong> situations. So how can we fix it? This is a cultural problem, not a technical problem. More precisely, the <strong>problems</strong> have technical <strong><strong>aspects</strong></strong>, but those <strong><strong>aspects</strong></strong> vary wildly from project to project. Maintaining <strong>AngularJS</strong> <strong>projects</strong> is very different from maintaining <strong>COBOL</strong> <strong>projects</strong>. The cultural stories, though, may be more similar. <strong>Someone</strong> at <strong>CSSDevConf</strong> last <strong>fall</strong> took the first <strong>step</strong> on that <strong>path</strong>, asking the <strong>audience</strong> how many of them moved from new <strong><strong>project</strong></strong> to new <strong><strong>project</strong></strong> and how many stayed on <strong><strong>project</strong></strong>s for a long time going forward. That prompted some <strong>blunt</strong> <strong>conversations</strong> about the <strong>differences</strong> among <strong>Web</strong> <strong>developers</strong> and their <strong>priorities</strong>, though it was clear that it was just a first step. <strong>DevOps</strong> — I think because it values <strong>operations</strong> — takes <strong>maintenance</strong> seriously, insisting on covering the whole <strong>lifecycle</strong> of a <strong>product</strong> rather than the <strong>waterfall vision</strong> of <strong>perfection</strong> at the <strong>deployment</strong> of a project. <strong>Iteration</strong> and continuous <strong>development</strong> <strong>models</strong> put a <strong>gloss</strong> of new and fresh on what used to seem old and blocking. <strong>DevOps eases</strong> the <strong>problem</strong> and gives some of us a place to talk about it. Most of us, though, <strong>work</strong> in <strong>places</strong> whose <strong>projects</strong> have not been and likely will never be under the <strong>DevOps</strong> umbrella. It's also possible that <strong>projects</strong> that <strong>start</strong> in full <strong>DevOps</strong> mode dwindle and <strong>find</strong> <strong>themselves</strong> in more traditional maintenance. While I hope <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>approaches</strong> will prove contagious, something smaller seems like it might be more important. We need to place a much higher <strong>value</strong> on <strong>maintenance</strong> and maintainers. We need to <strong>worship</strong> <strong>maintainers</strong> with the same <strong>fervor</strong> we <strong>worship</strong> creators. We need to recognize that not having emergencies can mean more, despite being less visible than a well-handled emergency. We need to <strong>value continuity</strong> (in a <strong>bumpy world</strong>) as much as we value growth. We need to recognize that <strong>growth</strong> is <strong>pointless</strong> unless we provide it with a solid foundation. <strong>Editor</strong>'s <strong>note</strong>: if you're interested in <strong>finding</strong> out if a <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>approach</strong> will prove to be contagious within your <strong>organization</strong>, you'll want to check out the Effective <strong>DevOps</strong> <strong>training session</strong> at <strong>Velocity</strong> in Santa Clara May 27-29, 2015. This <strong>post</strong> is <strong>part</strong> of an ongoing <strong>exploration</strong> into cross-pollinating <strong>Web</strong> communities. <strong>Cropped</strong> <strong>switch image</strong> <strong>CC BY-SA</strong> 2.0 <strong>Andrew Hart</strong> via Flickr.
