I recently sat down with <strong>Khoi Vinh</strong>, <strong>vice president</strong> of <strong>user experience</strong> at <strong>Wildcard</strong> and co-founder of Kidpost. Previously, <strong>Vinh</strong> was co-founder and <strong>CEO</strong> of <strong>Mixel (</strong>acquired by <strong>Etsy</strong>, Inc.), <strong>design director</strong> of The <strong>New York Times Online</strong>, and co-founder of the <strong>design studio</strong> <strong>Behavior</strong>, LLC. Our <strong>conversation</strong> included a <strong>discussion</strong> of <strong>career</strong> <strong>paths</strong>; the much talked about new <strong>interaction model</strong>, <strong>cards</strong>; and <strong>advice</strong> for <strong>design</strong> entrepreneurs. <strong>Curiosity</strong> <strong>serves designers</strong> well
<strong>Vinh</strong> and I discussed the ever-evolving <strong>role</strong> of designers. He recently self-published How They <strong>Got There</strong>, a <strong>book</strong> of <strong>interviews</strong> with <strong>interaction</strong> <strong>designers</strong> who describe their <strong>career</strong> <strong>paths</strong> and <strong>offer advice</strong> and insight. <strong>Vinh</strong> explained:
"How They <strong>Got There</strong> is <strong>kind</strong> of like the <strong>book</strong> I wish I could have read when I was just starting out in my career. The central <strong>thesis</strong> is that very few <strong>careers</strong> are truly planned out, A to <strong>B</strong>, to <strong>C</strong>, to <strong>Z</strong>, and it's usually a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>stuff</strong> that just happens by <strong>circumstance</strong> or blind <strong>luck</strong>, or through <strong>someone</strong> who knows <strong>someone</strong>. "As I became more and more aware of that in my <strong>career</strong>, I started to find those <strong>stories</strong> really interesting, really revealing, because they say so much about the <strong>character</strong> of <strong>people</strong> who achieve <strong>notoriety</strong> in their <strong>career</strong>s; the circumstances that led them to where they are can be fascinating. In a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>instances</strong>, the <strong>things</strong> that <strong>get</strong> these <strong>people</strong> onto these <strong>paths</strong> are very, very minor <strong>events</strong> or minor coincidences. <strong>…</strong> There's a <strong>serendipity</strong>, but I think, one <strong>thing</strong> that comes out when you read these <strong>stories</strong> is what <strong>serves</strong> these <strong>designers</strong> really well is <strong>curiosity</strong>, a <strong>willingness</strong> to be available to opportunities, so to speak. They go with the flow. They let one <strong>thing turn</strong> into another through their <strong>ability</strong> to acclimate themselves to various situations. "What's that old saying from Branch Rickey — “luck is the residue of design”? These <strong>careers</strong> are somewhat serendipitous, but they are really the <strong>result</strong> of <strong>folks</strong> who are very conscientious about making the most of <strong>whatever situation</strong> they had and working really hard and applying themselves, and looking at the <strong>world</strong> around them with great <strong>curiosity</strong> and being really willing to <strong>study</strong> what it takes to get to the next <strong>level.”</strong>

<strong>Reinventing</strong> the mobile <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong>, one <strong>card</strong> at a <strong>time</strong>
<strong>Vinh</strong> is working on creating the next <strong>generation</strong> of the mobile <strong><strong>Web</strong></strong> with his <strong>company</strong> Wild<strong>card</strong>. <strong>Cards</strong>, the <strong>emerging interaction model</strong> perhaps made most famous by <strong>Tinder</strong>, provide a faster, efficient, and — some would say — more natural <strong>way</strong> of accessing and interacting with information. <strong>Vinh</strong> has a <strong>post</strong> that includes a <strong>presentation</strong> from <strong>Chris Tse</strong> on just what cards are. <strong>(</strong><strong>Here’s</strong> another great <strong>talk</strong> by Chris Tse.) In our <strong>conversation</strong>, <strong>Vinh</strong> shared <strong>Wildcard’s</strong> <strong>goals</strong> and <strong>vision</strong>:
“The high-level <strong>message</strong> here is, we're trying to build a better mobile Web. Our <strong>belief</strong> is that the <strong>metaphor</strong> of <strong><strong>pages</strong></strong> for navigating the <strong>Internet</strong> worked really well on the <strong>desktop</strong> <strong>Web</strong>, but when it comes to your <strong>phone</strong>, navigating <strong><strong>pages</strong></strong> can be really painful and inefficient. That's why the mobile <strong>browser</strong> on your <strong>phone</strong>, whether it's <strong>Safari</strong> or <strong>Chrome</strong>, or even mobile <strong>Firefox</strong>, it's probably the least loved of the <strong>apps</strong> on your <strong>phone</strong> relative to how often you use it. That's because <strong>Web</strong> <strong>pages</strong> on a phone are slow, they're not particularly robust, they're constantly reloading — they're fragile. "We want to bring a native-<strong><strong>app</strong></strong> <strong>level</strong> of <strong>richness</strong> in <strong>terms</strong> of <strong>interactivity</strong> and <strong>responsiveness</strong>, and <strong>robustness</strong> to the mobile <strong>Web</strong>; we want you to be able to call upon that <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>functionality</strong> on the <strong>fly</strong> without having to download a big native <strong><strong>app</strong></strong> from one of the <strong><strong>app</strong></strong> stores to do that. I think that's one of the fundamental drawbacks of the native app ecosystem. "We're kind of trying to forge a third <strong>path</strong>, where we have our <strong><strong>browser</strong></strong>, it's a native <strong><strong>browser</strong></strong> on <strong>iOS</strong>, you open it up and you can type in a <strong>brand</strong> or a <strong>publisher</strong> and <strong>grab</strong> just the <strong>content</strong> that you need from their website; we'll pull it up and <strong>format</strong> it into what we call <strong>cards</strong>, which are standard and very fast — they're built on native <strong>code</strong>, and they give you this <strong>access</strong> without all of the <strong>performance</strong> <strong>penalties</strong> of a <strong>Web</strong> <strong><strong>browser</strong></strong>. We're working to create an <strong>index</strong> of <strong>countless</strong> <strong>cards</strong> both on our <strong>servers</strong> and also trying to work with <strong>publishers</strong> and <strong>merchants</strong> and <strong>brands</strong> out there to 'cardify' their <strong>content</strong> so that there's a rich <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>cards</strong> to call upon. That's the big <strong>vision</strong> of what we're trying to do.”
Advice for <strong>designer-founders</strong>
More and more, we’re <strong>seeing</strong> <strong>designers</strong> start their own companies. <strong>Vinh</strong> talked about the <strong>mix</strong> of <strong>skills</strong> needed for any <strong>designer</strong>-founder to have a <strong>shot</strong> at <strong>success</strong>:
“It's more likely that a <strong>designer</strong> will start a <strong>company today</strong> than at any time before. I think that's really, really wonderful because it signals that <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> is more necessary than ever, and if you have strong <strong><strong>design</strong></strong> <strong>skills</strong>, you have a better <strong>chance</strong> of making a successful <strong>business</strong> now than you did in the past 10 or 20 years. I think the <strong>call</strong> for <strong><strong>designers</strong></strong> to become <strong><strong>founder</strong>s</strong>, on the whole, is a good <strong>thing</strong>, but I think <strong><strong>designers</strong></strong> really have to understand what it means to become a <strong>founder</strong> and to take on the <strong>challenge</strong> of <strong>building</strong> a <strong>company</strong>, not just <strong>building</strong> a <strong>product</strong> or just designing a <strong>product</strong>. I think that's a really important <strong>distinction</strong> that can be hard for a <strong>lot</strong> of designers to traverse. Understanding all of the <strong>implications</strong> of being responsible for a <strong><strong>company</strong></strong>, not just being responsible for a <strong>design</strong>, really understanding that making <strong>sure</strong> that <strong><strong>company</strong></strong> survives from day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month is a whole different challenge. <strong>Design</strong> can be a big <strong>part</strong> of that and can really help it, but it's not always the complete solution. I think that's important for <strong><strong><strong>designers</strong></strong></strong>, especially young <strong><strong><strong>designers</strong></strong></strong>, to understand as the <strong>drumbeat</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>designers</strong></strong></strong> becoming <strong>founders gets</strong> louder every <strong>year.”</strong>
