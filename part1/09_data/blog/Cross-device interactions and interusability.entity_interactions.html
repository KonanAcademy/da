    <body><strong>Editor’s</strong> note: This is an <strong>excerpt</strong> by <strong>Claire Rowland</strong> from our <strong>upcoming book</strong> <strong>Designing Connected</strong> Products. This <strong>excerpt</strong> is included in our curated <strong>collection</strong> of <strong>chapters</strong> from the O’Reilly <strong>Design</strong> library. <strong>Download</strong> a free <strong>copy</strong> of the <strong>Designing</strong> for the <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong> ebook here. In <strong>systems</strong> where <strong>functionality</strong> and <strong>interactions</strong> are distributed across more than one <strong>device</strong>, <strong>it’s</strong> not enough to design individual <strong>UIs</strong> in isolation. <strong>Designers</strong> need to create a <strong>coherent</strong> <strong>UX</strong> across all the <strong>devices</strong> with which the user interacts. That means thinking about how <strong>UIs</strong> <strong>work</strong> together to create a <strong>coherent understanding</strong> of the overall <strong>system</strong>, and how the <strong>user</strong> may move between using different devices. <strong>Cross-platform</strong> <strong>UX</strong> and <strong>usability</strong>

[/caption]Many of the <strong>tools</strong> of <strong>UX</strong> <strong>design</strong> and <strong>HCI</strong> <strong>originate</strong> from a <strong>time</strong> when an <strong>interaction</strong> was usually a single <strong>user</strong> using a single device. This was almost always a <strong>desktop computer</strong>, which they’d be using to complete a work-like <strong>task</strong>, giving it more or less their full attention. The reality of our digital lives moved on from this long ago. Many of us own <strong>multiple</strong> Internet-capable <strong>devices</strong>, such as <strong>smartphones</strong>, <strong>tablets</strong>, and connected <strong>TVs</strong>, used for <strong>leisure</strong> as well as for work. They have different <strong>form</strong> <strong>factors</strong>; may be used in different <strong>contexts</strong>; and some of them come with specific <strong>sensing</strong> <strong>capabilities</strong>, such as mobile location. <strong>Cross-platform</strong> <strong>UX</strong> is an <strong>area</strong> of huge <strong>interest</strong> to the practitioner community. But academic <strong>researchers</strong> have given little <strong>attention</strong> to <strong>defining</strong> the <strong>properties</strong> of good <strong>cross-platform</strong> UX. This has left a <strong>gap</strong> between <strong>practice</strong> and theory that needs addressing. In <strong>industry practice</strong>, cross-platform <strong>UX</strong> has often proceeded <strong>device</strong> by <strong>device</strong>. <strong>Designers</strong> begin with a key <strong>reference device</strong> and <strong>subsequent</strong> <strong>interfaces</strong> are treated as adaptations. In the early <strong>days</strong> of <strong>smartphones</strong>, this <strong>reference device</strong> was often the desktop. In recent <strong>years</strong>, the "mobile first" <strong>approach</strong> has encouraged us to start with mobile <strong>Web</strong> or <strong>apps</strong> as a <strong>way</strong> to focus on optimizing key functionality and minimize "feature-itis." Such <strong>services</strong> usually have overarching <strong>design</strong> <strong>guidelines</strong> spanning all <strong>platforms</strong> to ensure a <strong>degree</strong> of consistency. The <strong>aim</strong> is usually on making the different <strong>interfaces</strong> feel like a <strong>family</strong>, rather than on making the <strong><strong>device</strong>s</strong> work together as a system.more
This <strong>works</strong> when each <strong>device</strong> is delivering broadly the same functionality. <strong>Evernote</strong>, <strong>eBay</strong>, and <strong>Dropbox</strong> are typical <strong>examples</strong>: each <strong>offers</strong> more or less the same <strong>features</strong> via a responsive <strong>website</strong> and <strong>smartphone</strong> apps. The <strong>design</strong> is optimized for each <strong>device</strong>, but provides the same basic <strong>service functionality</strong> (<strong>bar</strong> a few <strong>admin</strong> <strong>functions</strong> that might only be available on the desktop). But this <strong>approach</strong> breaks down when the <strong>system</strong> involves very diverse <strong>devices</strong> with different <strong>capabilities</strong> working in concert. In <strong>IoT</strong>, many <strong>devices</strong> do not even have <strong>screens</strong>, or an on-device user interface. <strong>Multiple</strong> <strong>devices</strong> might have <strong>UIs</strong> with very different <strong>forms</strong> or specialized functionality. Even if the <strong>UI</strong> is only on one <strong>device</strong>, the <strong>service</strong> still depends on all the <strong>device</strong>s working together in concert. <strong>It’s</strong> not possible to <strong>design</strong> a <strong>system</strong> like this by <strong>thinking</strong> about one <strong>device</strong> at a <strong>time</strong>: this is likely to create a disjointed experience. In <strong>order</strong> to use it effectively, the <strong>user</strong> has to <strong>form</strong> a <strong>coherent</strong> mental <strong>image</strong> of the overall system. This includes its various <strong>parts</strong>, what each does, and how different <strong>objectives</strong> can be achieved using the system as a whole. Traditional single-device usability doesn’t tell us very much about how to do this. What is interusability? <strong>Charles Denis</strong> and <strong>Laurent Karsenty</strong> first coined the <strong>term</strong> "<strong>inter-usability</strong>" in 2004 to describe <strong>UX</strong> across <strong>multiple</strong> devices. <strong>Conventional</strong> <strong>usability theory</strong> is under-equipped to cope with cross-platform design. However, one 2010 <strong>paper</strong> (<strong>PDF</strong>) by <strong>Minna Wäljas</strong>, <strong>Katarina Segerståhl</strong>, <strong>Kaisa Väänänen-Vainio-Mattila</strong>, and <strong>Harri Oinas-Kukkonen</strong> proposes a practical <strong>model</strong> of interusability. Wäljas, <strong>et al</strong>, <strong>propose</strong> that the ultimate <strong>goal</strong> of <strong>cross-platform design</strong> is that the <strong>experience</strong> should feel coherent. Does the <strong>service feel</strong> like the <strong>devices</strong> are working in <strong>concert</strong>, or does the <strong>UX</strong> feel fragmented? They define three key <strong>concepts</strong> for cross-platform <strong>service</strong> <strong>UX</strong>, which together ensure a <strong>coherent experience</strong>:

<strong>Composition</strong>: how <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong> and <strong>functionality</strong> are organized
<strong>Appropriate</strong> <strong>consistency</strong> of <strong>interfaces</strong> across different <strong><strong>devices</strong></strong>
<strong>Continuity</strong> of <strong>content</strong> and <strong>data</strong> to ensure smooth <strong>transitions</strong> between <strong>platforms</strong>

The <strong>paper</strong> was published in 2010, and the <strong>service</strong>s evaluated (including <strong>Nike+</strong> and Nokia Sportstracker) now inevitably feel a little dated. But we have found the <strong>model</strong> still holds up well in our own <strong>work designing</strong> <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>services</strong>, and <strong>it’s</strong> a key <strong>reference</strong> for the <strong>rest</strong> of this chapter.
