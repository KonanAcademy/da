    <body><strong>Experts</strong> from across the <strong>software architecture world</strong> came together in <strong>Boston</strong> for the O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2015. Below we've assembled notable <strong>keynotes</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong>, and <strong>insights</strong> from the event. <strong>Software</strong> <strong>architects</strong>: post-"post-useful"
The old <strong>notion</strong> of a <strong><strong>software architect</strong></strong> being a non-coding, post-useful <strong>deep thinker</strong> is giving <strong>way</strong> to <strong>something</strong> far more interesting, says <strong>Neal Ford</strong>, <strong><strong>software architect</strong></strong> and <strong>meme wrangler</strong> at ThoughtWorks. "<strong>Architecture</strong> has become much more interesting now because it's become more encompassing ... it's trying to solve real <strong>problems</strong> rather than <strong>play</strong> with abstractions." more

<strong><strong>Software</strong></strong> <strong><strong>development</strong></strong> is an <strong>engineering discipline</strong>
"<strong><strong>Software</strong></strong> <strong><strong>development</strong></strong> is like an <strong>art</strong>, and it is like a <strong>science</strong>, and it is like a <strong>craft</strong>, and it is a unique <strong>thing</strong> that's never existed before," says <strong>Glenn Vanderburg</strong>, <strong>chief architect</strong> of LivingSocial. "That doesn't mean it's not also engineering. And we should think of it that way." A <strong><strong>code</strong>base</strong> that reflects your architectural <strong>intent</strong>
<strong>Linking</strong> <strong>software architecture</strong> with <strong>code</strong> <strong>requires</strong> <strong>collaboration</strong> from both <strong>sides</strong>, says independent <strong>consultant</strong> Simon Brown. <strong>Architects</strong> need to be on <strong>code</strong> <strong>teams</strong> and <strong>developers</strong> need to step back to see the bigger picture. <strong>Agile</strong> + <strong><strong>architecture</strong></strong>, not agile <strong>vs</strong> <strong><strong>architecture</strong></strong>
In <strong>exploring</strong> the <strong>relationship</strong> between software <strong><strong>architecture</strong></strong> and agile <strong>development</strong>, <strong>ThoughtWorks</strong>' <strong>Molly Dishman</strong> and <strong>Martin Fowler</strong> <strong>tackle</strong> two questions: 1. What is software architecture? 2. How do you ensure architecture is happening? <strong>Modern</strong> <strong>business</strong> has a new <strong><strong><strong>goal</strong></strong></strong>, which means it needs a new <strong>platform</strong>
<strong>Sam Ramji</strong>, <strong>CEO</strong> of the <strong>Cloud Foundry Foundation</strong>, outlines a <strong>vision</strong> for a cloud-native application <strong>platform</strong> that helps <strong>business</strong>es <strong>shift</strong> from the old <strong><strong><strong>goal</strong></strong></strong> of sustainable competitive <strong>advantage</strong> to the modern <strong><strong><strong>goal</strong></strong></strong> of continuous innovation. "<strong><strong>Microservices</strong></strong>" might become a <strong><strong>buzzword</strong></strong>, but the underlying <strong>ideas</strong> are important
<strong><strong>Microservices</strong></strong> appear to be in a "<strong><strong>buzzword</strong></strong> bingo" <strong>phase</strong>, says <strong>NGINX</strong> <strong>evangelist</strong> and <strong>community leader</strong> <strong>Sarah Novotny</strong>, "but <strong>attention</strong> is being paid to a very good architectural paradigm." <strong>Novotny</strong> also discusses the <strong>convergence</strong> of <strong>software architecture</strong> and <strong>DevOps</strong>, and the potential for <strong>microservices</strong> to shape organizational culture.
