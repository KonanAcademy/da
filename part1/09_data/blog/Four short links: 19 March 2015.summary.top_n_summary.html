Using Monitoring Dashboards to Change Behaviour -- [After years of neglect] One day we wrote some brittle Ruby scripts that polled various services.</strong> <strong>They collated the metrics into a simple database and we automated some email reports and built a dashboard showing key service metrics.</strong> We pinpointed issues that we wanted to show people. Things like the login times, how long it would take to search for certain keywords in the app, and how many users were actually using the service, along with costs and other interesting facts. <strong>We sent out the link to the dashboard at 9am on Monday morning, before the weekly management call.</strong> Within 2 weeks most problems were addressed. It is very difficult to combat data, especially when it is laid out in an easy to understand way.
