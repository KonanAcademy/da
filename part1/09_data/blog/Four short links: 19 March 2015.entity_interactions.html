Using <strong>Monitoring Dashboards</strong> to <strong>Change Behaviour</strong> -- [After <strong>years</strong> of neglect<strong>]</strong> One <strong>day</strong> we wrote some <strong>brittle</strong> <strong>Ruby</strong> <strong>scripts</strong> that polled various services. They collated the <strong>metrics</strong> into a simple <strong>database</strong> and we automated some <strong>email</strong> <strong>reports</strong> and built a <strong>dashboard</strong> showing key <strong>service</strong> <strong>metrics</strong>. We pinpointed issues that we wanted to show people. <strong>Things</strong> like the <strong>login</strong> times, how long it would take to search for certain <strong>keywords</strong> in the <strong>app</strong>, and how many <strong>users</strong> were actually using the <strong>service</strong>, along with <strong>costs</strong> and other interesting facts. We sent out the <strong>link</strong> to the <strong>dashboard</strong> at 9am on <strong>Monday</strong> <strong>morning</strong>, before the weekly management call. <strong>Within</strong> 2 <strong>weeks</strong> most problems were addressed. It is very difficult to combat data, especially when it is laid out in an easy to understand way. Quiet <strong>Mitsubishi Cars</strong> -- noise-cancelling on <strong>phone</strong> <strong>calls</strong> by using <strong>machine</strong> learning to build the filters. <strong><strong>NSF</strong> Requiring Public Access</strong> -- <strong>NSF</strong> will require that <strong>articles</strong> in peer-reviewed scholarly <strong>journals</strong> and <strong>papers</strong> in juried <strong>conference</strong> <strong>proceedings</strong> or <strong>transactions</strong> be deposited in a public <strong>access compliant repository</strong> and be available for <strong>download</strong>, <strong>reading</strong>, and <strong>analysis</strong> within one <strong>year</strong> of publication. <strong>Filtered</strong> for <strong>Capital</strong> (Matt Webb) -- It's important to get a <strong><strong>credit</strong> line</strong> [for <strong>hardware</strong> <strong>startups</strong>] because growing organically isn't possible -- even if <strong>half</strong> your sell-in <strong>price</strong> is <strong><strong>margin</strong></strong>, you can only afford to grow your <strong>batch size</strong> at 50<strong>%</strong> per <strong>cycle</strong>... and whether it's <strong>credit</strong> or re-investing the <strong><strong>margin</strong></strong>, all that <strong>growth</strong> <strong>incurs</strong> risk, because the items aren't pre-sold. There are double binds all over the place here.
