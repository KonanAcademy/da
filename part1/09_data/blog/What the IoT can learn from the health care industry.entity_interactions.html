    <body>Adrian Gropper co-authored this post. After a short <strong>period</strong> of <strong>excitement</strong> and <strong>rosy</strong> <strong>prospects</strong> in the <strong>movement</strong> we’ve <strong>come</strong> to call the <strong>Internet</strong> of Things (IoT), <strong>designers</strong> are coming to realize that it will survive or implode around the <strong>twin</strong> <strong>issues</strong> of <strong>security</strong> and <strong>user control</strong>: a few electrical <strong>failures</strong> could scare <strong>people</strong> away for <strong>decades</strong>, while a <strong>nagging sense</strong> that <strong>someone</strong> is exploiting our <strong>data</strong> without our <strong>consent</strong> could sour our enthusiasm. Early <strong>indicators</strong> already point to a heightened <strong>level</strong> of <strong>scrutiny</strong> — <strong>Senator Ed Markey’s</strong> <strong>office</strong>, for <strong>example</strong>, recently put the <strong>automobile industry</strong> under the <strong>microscope</strong> for <strong>computer</strong> and network security. In this <strong>context</strong>, what can the <strong>IoT</strong> <strong>draw</strong> from well-established <strong>technologies</strong> in federated trust? <strong>Federated</strong> trust in <strong>technologies</strong> as diverse as the <strong>Kerberos</strong> and <strong>SAML</strong> has allowed large <strong>groups</strong> of <strong>users</strong> to collaborate securely, never having to share <strong>passwords</strong> with people they don’t trust. <strong>OpenID</strong> was probably the first truly mass-market <strong>application</strong> of federated trust. <strong>OpenID</strong> and <strong>OAuth</strong>, which have proven their <strong>value</strong> on the <strong>Web</strong>, have an equally vital <strong>role</strong> in the <strong>exchange</strong> of <strong>data</strong> in health care. This <strong>task</strong> — often cast as the <strong>interoperability</strong> of electronic <strong>health</strong> <strong>records</strong> — can reasonably be described as the primary <strong>challenge</strong> facing the <strong>health</strong> care industry today, at least in the IT space. <strong>Reformers</strong> across the <strong>health care industry</strong> (and even <strong>Congress</strong>) have pressured the federal <strong>government</strong> to make <strong>data</strong> <strong>exchange</strong> the top <strong>priority</strong>, and the <strong>Office</strong> of the <strong>National Coordinator</strong> for <strong>Health Information Technology</strong> has declared it the <strong>centerpiece</strong> of upcoming regulations.more
<strong>Furthermore</strong>, other <strong>industries</strong> can learn from health care. The <strong>Internet</strong> of <strong>Things</strong> <strong>deals</strong> not only with distributed <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, but with distributed <strong>responsibility</strong> for maintaining the <strong>quality</strong> of that <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> and authorizing the sharing of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>. The <strong>use case</strong> we'll discuss in this <strong>article</strong>, where an individual <strong>allows</strong> her medical <strong>device</strong> <strong>data</strong> to be shared with a <strong>provider</strong>, can show a <strong>way forward</strong> for many other industries. For <strong>instance</strong>, it can steer a <strong>path</strong> toward better <strong>security</strong> and <strong>user control</strong> for the auto industry. <strong>Health</strong> <strong>care</strong>, like other vertical <strong>industries</strong>, does best by <strong>exploiting</strong> general <strong>technologies</strong> that cross <strong>industries</strong>. When it depends on localized <strong>solutions</strong> designed for a single <strong>industry</strong>, the <strong>results</strong> usually cost a <strong>lot</strong> more, <strong>lock</strong> the <strong>users</strong> into proprietary <strong>vendors</strong>, and suffer from lower quality. In <strong>pursuit</strong> of a standard <strong>solution</strong>, a <strong>working group</strong> of the <strong>OpenID Foundation</strong> called Health Relationship Trust (HEART) is putting together a <strong>set</strong> of <strong>technologies</strong> that would:

Keep <strong>patient control</strong> over <strong>data</strong> and allow her to determine precisely which <strong>providers</strong> have access. <strong>Cut</strong> out <strong>middlemen</strong>, such as expensive <strong>health <strong>information</strong></strong> <strong>exchanges</strong> that have trouble identifying <strong>patients</strong> and keeping <strong>information</strong> up to date. <strong>Avoid</strong> the <strong>need</strong> for a <strong>patient</strong> and <strong>provider</strong> to share secrets. Each <strong>maintains</strong> their <strong>credentials</strong> with their own trusted <strong>service</strong>, and connect with each other without having to reveal passwords. <strong>Allow</strong> <strong>data transfers</strong> directly (or through a patient-controlled <strong>proxy app</strong>) from <strong>fitness</strong> or medical <strong>devices</strong> to the <strong>provider’s</strong> electronic <strong>record</strong>, as specified by the patient. <strong>Standard</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> from <strong>OpenID</strong> used by <strong>HEART</strong> include <strong>OAuth</strong>, <strong>OpenID</strong> Connect, and User-Managed <strong>Access</strong> (UMA). A sophisticated <strong>use case</strong> developed by the <strong>HEART</strong> <strong>team</strong> describes two <strong>health care</strong> providers that are geographically remote from each other and do not know each other. The <strong>patient</strong> gets her <strong>routine care</strong> from one but needs <strong>treatment</strong> from the other during a trip. <strong>OAuth</strong> and <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> <strong>work</strong> here the <strong>way</strong> they do on <strong>countless</strong> popular <strong>web<strong>site</strong>s</strong>: they extend the <strong>trust</strong> that a <strong><strong>user</strong></strong> invested in one <strong>site</strong> to cover another <strong>site</strong> with which the <strong><strong>user</strong></strong> wants to do business. The <strong>user</strong> has a <strong>password</strong> or credential with just a single trusted site; dedicated <strong>tokens</strong> (sometimes temporary<strong>) grant</strong> limited <strong>access</strong> to other sites. <strong>Devices</strong> can also support <strong>OAuth</strong> and related technologies. The <strong>HEART</strong> <strong>use case</strong> suggests two hypothetical <strong>devices</strong>, one a <strong>consumer product</strong> and the other a more expensive, dedicated medical device. These <strong>become</strong> key <strong>links</strong> between the <strong>patient</strong> and her physicians. The <strong>patient</strong> can authorize the <strong>device</strong> to send her vital <strong>signs</strong> independently to the physician of her choice. <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> can relieve the <strong>patient</strong> of the <strong>need</strong> to enter a <strong>password</strong> every <strong>time</strong> she wants <strong>access</strong> to her records. For <strong>instance</strong>, the <strong>patient</strong> might want to use her <strong>cell phone</strong> to verify her identity. This is sometimes called <strong>multisig technology</strong> and is designed to avoid a catastrophic <strong>loss</strong> of <strong>control</strong> over <strong>data</strong> and avoid a single <strong>point</strong> of failure. One could think of <strong>identity federation</strong> via <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> as promoting cybersecurity. <strong>UMA</strong> <strong>extends</strong> the <strong>possibilities</strong> for <strong>secure</strong> data sharing. It can allow a single <strong>authorization server</strong> to <strong>control access</strong> to <strong>data</strong> on many <strong>resource</strong> servers. <strong>UMA</strong> can also enforce any <strong>policy set</strong> up by the <strong>authorization server</strong> on <strong>behalf</strong> of the patient. If the <strong>patient</strong> wants to release surgical <strong><strong>records</strong></strong> without releasing mental <strong>health</strong> <strong><strong>records</strong></strong>, or wants <strong><strong>records</strong></strong> released only during <strong>business</strong> <strong>hours</strong> as a <strong>security measure</strong>, <strong>UMA</strong> enables the <strong>authorization server</strong> to design arbitrarily defined <strong>rules</strong> to support such practices. One could think of <strong>identity federation</strong> via <strong>OpenID Connect</strong> as promoting <strong>cybersecurity</strong> by <strong>replacing</strong> many weak passwords with one strong credential. On top of that, <strong>UMA</strong> promotes <strong>privacy</strong> by <strong>replacing</strong> many <strong>consent</strong> <strong>portals</strong> with one patient-selected authorization agent. For <strong>instance</strong>, the <strong><strong><strong>patient</strong></strong></strong> can tell her <strong>devices</strong> to release <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> in the <strong>future</strong> without requiring another <strong>request</strong> to the <strong><strong><strong>patient</strong></strong></strong>, and can specify what <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> is available to each <strong>provider</strong>, and even when it's available <strong>—</strong> if the <strong><strong><strong>patient</strong></strong></strong> is traveling, for <strong>example</strong>, and needs to see a <strong><strong>doctor</strong></strong>, she can tell the <strong>authentication server</strong> to shut off <strong>access</strong> to her <strong><strong><strong>data</strong></strong></strong> by that <strong><strong>doctor</strong></strong> on the <strong>day</strong> after she takes her <strong>flight</strong> back home. The <strong>patient</strong> could also require that <strong>anyone</strong> viewing her <strong>data</strong> submit <strong>credentials</strong> that demonstrate they have a certain medical degree. Thus, low-cost <strong>services</strong> already in widespread <strong>use</strong> can cut the <strong>Gordian</strong> <strong>knot</strong> of <strong>information</strong> siloing in health care. <strong>There’s</strong> no <strong>duplication</strong> of <strong><strong>data</strong></strong>, either <strong>—</strong> the <strong>patient</strong> maintains it in her <strong>records</strong>, and the <strong>provider</strong> has <strong>access</strong> to the <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> released to them by the <strong>patient</strong>. <strong>Gropper</strong>, who initiated work on the <strong>HEART</strong> <strong>use case</strong> cited earlier, calls this “an <strong>HIE</strong> of <strong>One.” Federated</strong> <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>authorization</strong>, with <strong>provision</strong> for direct <strong>user control</strong> over <strong>data</strong> sharing, provides the best <strong>security</strong> we currently know without the <strong>need</strong> to compromise private <strong>keys</strong> or <strong>share</strong> <strong>secrets</strong>, such as passwords. <strong>Image</strong> on <strong>article</strong> and <strong>category</strong> <strong>pages</strong> by <strong>erik forsberg</strong> on <strong>Flickr</strong>, used under a <strong>Creative Commons</strong> license.
