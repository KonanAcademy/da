We often hear about how the <strong>tech job market</strong> is booming and has <strong>space</strong> for <strong>newcomers</strong>, but what does that mean for the <strong>developers</strong> already in the market? In <strong>December</strong> of 2014, <strong>Fortune.com</strong> predicted that 2015 would be an <strong>excellent year</strong> for <strong>developers</strong> to change jobs. Citing Dice.com, they note that jobs are popping up all over the country. In <strong>fact</strong>, <strong>Diceâ€™s</strong> <strong>survey</strong> also reports 40<strong>%</strong> of hiring <strong>managers</strong> seeing voluntary <strong>departures</strong>, a higher <strong>number</strong> than was seen just six months earlier. These are all large, general numbers. What does a <strong>job change</strong>, and the <strong>changing market</strong>, look like for individual developers? To get a better <strong>sense</strong>, I spoke with <strong>Jason Myers</strong>, who is working on our <strong>upcoming</strong> <strong>Essential SQLAlchemy</strong>, 2e title. <strong>Jason</strong> recently went from <strong>working</strong> for the <strong>email marketing service</strong> <strong>Emma</strong>, <strong>Inc.</strong>, to <strong>working</strong> for net<strong>working</strong> giant Cisco. Here, he talks about how a change like that feels, and how the market looks to him. more
How recently have you changed jobs? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I changed <strong>jobs</strong> just three weeks ago. What was your previous title, and what is your new one? <strong>Jason <strong>My</strong>ers</strong>: <strong>My</strong> previous <strong><strong>title</strong></strong> was <strong>Systems</strong> <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and my current <strong><strong>title</strong></strong> is <strong>Software Engineer</strong> IV. <strong>Do</strong> you feel it's a big <strong>change</strong> between the two roles? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: It was quite a <strong>jump</strong>, I went from working primarily on <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>API</strong> <strong>development</strong> to work on <strong>OpenStack</strong>, CI/CD, and <strong>Linux</strong> <strong>deployment</strong> <strong>systems</strong> and installers. It was also a <strong>move</strong> from being on a smaller <strong>team</strong> in a 150 <strong>person company</strong> to a very large company. Finally, a <strong>move</strong> to <strong>working</strong> from home full-time. What other titles have you held in your career? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I've been a <strong>Network Engineer</strong>, <strong>Network Design</strong> and <strong>Implementation Engineer</strong>, <strong>Systems Synergist</strong>, <strong>Manager</strong> of <strong>Information</strong> <strong>Services</strong>, <strong>Consultant</strong>, Principal <strong>Consultant</strong>, Business <strong>Consultant</strong>, <strong>Systems Architect</strong>, <strong>Intern</strong>, <strong>Software Developer</strong>, <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, Systems <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, <strong>Software Engineer</strong> IV. Titles do nothing for me personally. I know they are often used to slot <strong>pay</strong> for a <strong>position</strong>, but I don't think much of them in the <strong>way</strong> of prestige. I prefer to just be a <strong>developer</strong> who is known for his <strong><strong>work</strong> ethic</strong> at <strong>work</strong> and in the <strong>community</strong>, and not my current title. What made you want to make this move? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I've been following the <strong>OpenStack</strong> <strong>project</strong> for a <strong>while</strong> as it is a huge <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>Python</strong> <strong>world</strong> at the <strong>moment</strong>, and I've wanted to work for <strong>Cisco</strong> for quite some time. I was a Systems Architect (Servers and Networking) for much of my professional <strong>career</strong> before switching to development. Can you say more about moving from a small company? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I think the <strong>way</strong> <strong>people</strong> feel about that is going to vary a <strong>lot</strong> from <strong>person</strong> to <strong>person</strong>. At a large <strong>company</strong> you are not as involved in each <strong>individual decision</strong>; however, that <strong>means</strong> you can focus more on the <strong>work</strong> in front of you. It also leads to more opportunities for research. While smaller <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> can tolerate some <strong>level</strong> of <strong>research</strong>, larger <strong><strong>companies</strong></strong> can enable bigger <strong>budgets</strong> for longer term <strong>research</strong>. They also can bring in talented <strong>engineers</strong> from other <strong>companies</strong> to talk to your <strong>staff</strong> and provide more <strong>opportunities</strong> for learning than just outside events. Many <strong>industries</strong> seem to be becoming more tolerant of working from <strong>home</strong>, do you feel this is a positive <strong>move</strong> for your industry in particular? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I again think this is a personal <strong>preference</strong> to some <strong>level</strong>; however, I find the current open <strong>office design</strong> to be bad for both <strong>developer productivity</strong> and a historical <strong>record</strong> of conversation. I find that when there is a <strong>remote</strong> centric <strong>workspace</strong> there <strong>tends</strong> to be more written <strong>communication</strong> and it is more asynchronous thus allowing you to respond when you take a <strong>break versus</strong> being interrupted in the <strong>middle</strong> of a thought stream. I've seen this <strong>done</strong> well inside of <strong>offices</strong> as well, but it often leaves <strong>remote</strong> <strong>workers</strong> off of the impromptu meeting stream, which I think is bad. <strong>Are</strong> <strong>job</strong> changes common? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I think it depends on the <strong>locale</strong> and the job market. I've changed a few <strong>times</strong> in the past few <strong>years</strong> as my <strong>development career</strong> has advanced and/or the <strong>startup</strong> I was working for <strong>underwent</strong> some big changes. I think it's fairly common because there is such a <strong>demand</strong> for <strong>development talent</strong>, and especially those that are known to deliver <strong>projects</strong> and be active in the community. <strong>Do</strong> <strong>people</strong> make lateral <strong>moves</strong>, or do you see a <strong>willingness</strong> to try new languages/technologies? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I tend to see <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> staying within a particular <strong>language</strong>, but I do see a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong><strong>people</strong></strong> complementing that with additional <strong>language</strong>s, and the <strong>type</strong> of <strong>technologies</strong> they choose to work on varies greatly. My view of this is probably skewed because I'm so embedded in Python. I don't think I've seen too many <strong>people</strong> make just plain lateral <strong>moves</strong> unless they where leaving a situation that wasn't right for them. In <strong>Nashville</strong>, there are a <strong>LOT</strong> of <strong>web development</strong> <strong>jobs</strong> in <strong>Python</strong>, but there is also <strong>data</strong> <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>OpenStack</strong>, etc. What I like about <strong>Nashville</strong> is there isn't a <strong>bunch</strong> of <strong>language hate</strong>, and <strong>everyone</strong> seems to want to learn additional languages. We see a <strong>lot</strong> of <strong>interest</strong> in functional <strong>languages</strong> like <strong>Elixir</strong> and <strong>F</strong># due to our great Nash<strong>F</strong>P group. What <strong>kind</strong> of <strong>resources</strong> are you aware of for <strong>developers</strong> making a career change? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: There are <strong>millions</strong> of <strong>resources</strong> available for <strong>online</strong> <strong>MOOCs</strong> and <strong>bootcamps</strong>, etc. None of those can compare to participating in the local developer community. I was a <strong>fixture</strong> at many <strong>meetups</strong> and <strong>events</strong> prior to my first <strong>official job</strong> as a developer. This <strong>meant</strong> I knew <strong>people</strong> in the field I wanted to join. I knew who I could meet for <strong>coffee</strong> to get a <strong>deeper understanding</strong> of something. I had a <strong>cup</strong> of <strong>coffee</strong> with <strong>Cal Evans (</strong>famous PHP Cal), and that basically started my development career. In <strong>addition</strong>, those <strong>people</strong> can point you to how they learned or offer to teach you directly. One <strong>thing</strong> I want to <strong>stress</strong> though, is to get a project. Don't just do tutorial after tutorial. Until you have said I want to go <strong>build</strong> a <strong><strong>thing</strong></strong> without a <strong>guide</strong>, then put that <strong><strong>thing</strong></strong> live on the <strong>internet</strong>, and <strong>done</strong> it, you don't have a good <strong>picture</strong> of the actual <strong>work</strong> of a developer. You organize PyTN, do you feel there are more beginners now, or has it stayed pretty steady? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: There are a <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>beginners</strong>, and <strong>Nashville</strong>, like a <strong><strong>lot</strong></strong> of <strong>places</strong>, is hungry for mid to senior talent. Some of this is due to coding being the hot thing, and some of it is because that other fields aren't really hiring right now. I'm glad we have this <strong>influx</strong> of <strong>beginners</strong>, and I hope they stay for the long haul. However, I hope they continuously train because we need those mid to senior <strong>people</strong> to develop higher <strong>order</strong> <strong>solutions</strong> and help <strong>companies</strong> progress. I'm not an <strong>idealist</strong> about open <strong>source</strong>, I know it takes money to get somewhere. Would you consider moving to a completely different language/technology if the opportunity was interesting enough? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: <strong>Absolutely</strong>, provided the <strong>community</strong> around that language/technology was supporting and open. I gravitate <strong>towards</strong> <strong>Python</strong> because of the <strong>community</strong> and the <strong>need</strong> for it in our <strong>area</strong>, but previously I really enjoyed working in <strong>PHP</strong> and C#. <strong>Languages</strong> and <strong>technologies</strong> are just <strong>tools</strong> for a <strong>developer</strong>, and given enough <strong>time</strong> they will ebb and flow through our career. I do not tend to just go jump on the hot new bandwagon. I like <strong>Node</strong>, and help <strong>organize</strong> a <strong>conference</strong> on it in Nashville. However, I donâ€™t think I'd want to work full-time in that <strong>community</strong> until the rapid <strong>pace</strong> of <strong>change</strong> slows to a more maintainable state. I feel like we have several stable and maintainable technologies and Node will be joining them very soon. Nonetheless, my <strong>background</strong> as a <strong>systems</strong> <strong>person</strong> means that I tend to think about how to actually support, <strong>tune</strong>, and <strong>mature</strong> a <strong>piece</strong> of <strong>code</strong> rather than rewrite it in a new language, until that rewrite is also maintainable and required. Any final thoughts on the developer job market, or where you think itâ€™s going? <strong>Jason Myers</strong>: I think the <strong>market</strong> is going to continue to be challenging for <strong>employers</strong> and great for developers. There are still <strong>tons</strong> of <strong>beginners</strong> around filling that <strong>need</strong>, and I'm hoping more <strong>companies</strong> will pick them up, and devote resources to leveling them up more. It's still easy for mid to senior <strong>level</strong> <strong>engineers</strong> to move to other companies as they wish. However, my <strong>hope</strong> is that some <strong>stability</strong> <strong>occurs</strong> and there is less <strong>shuffle</strong> and a greater <strong>effort</strong> made to <strong>retaining</strong> that talent. As an <strong>older developer</strong> (I guess 35 is older<strong>)</strong>, I'd love to see fewer <strong><strong>developers</strong></strong> demanding superficial <strong>perks</strong>, and more of them asking to have more <strong>time</strong> to contribute to the open <strong>source</strong> <strong>products</strong> we use, <strong>mentor</strong> young <strong><strong>developers</strong></strong>, and <strong>learning</strong> more about the space they occupy. All of those <strong>result</strong> in us growing as <strong>developers</strong> in more than just our <strong>coding</strong> skills. I'm not sure how preachy this <strong>sounds</strong>, so some might view it as... <strong>get</strong> off my <strong>lawn</strong> and be good humans. This <strong>post</strong> is <strong>part</strong> of our ongoing <strong>exploration</strong> into what it means to actually be a software engineer.
