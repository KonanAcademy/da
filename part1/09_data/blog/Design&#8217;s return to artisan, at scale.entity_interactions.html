In this <strong>week</strong>'s <strong>Radar Podcast</strong> <strong>episode</strong>, <strong>Jon Follett</strong>, <strong>editor</strong> of <strong>Designing</strong> for <strong>Emerging</strong> <strong>Technologies</strong>, <strong>chats</strong> with <strong>Matt Nish-Lapidus</strong>, <strong>partner</strong> and <strong>design director</strong> at Normative. Their <strong>discussion</strong> <strong>circles</strong> around the <strong>evolution</strong> of <strong><strong>design</strong></strong>, <strong>characteristics</strong> of post-Industrial <strong><strong>design</strong></strong>, and aesthetic <strong>intricacies</strong> of <strong><strong>design</strong></strong>ing in networked systems. Also note, Nish-Lapidus will present a free <strong>webcast</strong> on these <strong>topics</strong> March 24, 2015. Post-Industrial <strong>design</strong> <strong>relationships</strong>
Nish-Lapidus <strong>shares</strong> an interesting <strong>take</strong> on <strong>design</strong> evolution, from pre-Industrial to post-Industrial <strong>times</strong>, through the <strong>lens</strong> of eyeglasses. He uses <strong>eyeglasses</strong> as a <strong>case study</strong>, he says, because they're a <strong>piece</strong> of <strong>technology</strong> that's been used through a broad <strong>span</strong> of <strong>history</strong>, <strong>longer</strong> than many of the <strong>things</strong> we still use today. Nish-Lapidus <strong>walks</strong> us through the pre-Industrial <strong><strong><strong><strong>era</strong></strong></strong></strong> — so, <strong>Medieval</strong> <strong>times</strong> through about the 1800s — where a single <strong>craftsperson</strong> <strong>design</strong>ed one <strong>product</strong> for a single individual; through the Industrial <strong><strong><strong><strong>era</strong></strong></strong></strong>, where mass-<strong>product</strong>ion <strong>took</strong> the main <strong>stage</strong>; to our modern post-Industrial <strong><strong><strong><strong>era</strong></strong></strong></strong>, where embedded <strong>personalization</strong> <strong>capabilities</strong> are bringing <strong>design</strong> almost full <strong>circle</strong>, back to a <strong>focus</strong> on the individual <strong>user</strong>:
"<strong>Once</strong> we move into this post-Industrial <strong><strong><strong><strong>era</strong></strong></strong></strong>, which we're kind of <strong>entering</strong> now, the <strong>relationship</strong>'s <strong>starting</strong> to shift again, and <strong>glasses</strong> are a really interesting example. We go from having a single <strong><strong><strong>pair</strong></strong></strong> of <strong><strong><strong>glasses</strong></strong></strong> made for a single <strong>person</strong>, hand-made usually, to a <strong><strong><strong>pair</strong></strong></strong> of <strong><strong><strong>glasses</strong></strong></strong> designed and then mass-manufactured for a <strong>countless number</strong> of <strong>people</strong>, to having a <strong><strong><strong>pair</strong></strong></strong> of <strong><strong><strong>glasses</strong></strong></strong> that expresses a <strong>lot</strong> of different things. On one <strong>hand</strong>, you have <strong>something</strong> like <strong>Google Glass</strong>, which is still mass-produced, but the <strong>glasses</strong> actually contain embedded functionality. Then we also have, with the <strong>emergence</strong> of 3D printing and small-scale <strong>manufacturing</strong>, a <strong>return</strong> to a little <strong>bit</strong> of that <strong>artisan</strong>, one-to-one <strong>relationship</strong>, where you could get <strong>something</strong> that someone's made just for you. "These post-Industrial <strong>objects</strong> are more of an <strong>expression</strong> of the networked world in which we now live. We [again] have a <strong>way</strong> of <strong>building</strong> relationships with individual crafts-people. We also have <strong>objects</strong> that <strong>exist</strong> in the <strong>network</strong> themselves, as a physical <strong>instantiation</strong> of the <strong>network</strong>ed environment that we live in." more

Beyond the <strong>object</strong>, back to the <strong>user</strong>
This <strong>movement</strong> toward <strong>personalization</strong> and personalized <strong>services</strong> is affecting post-Industrial <strong>design</strong> in a <strong>number</strong> of ways. Nish-Lapidus <strong>talks</strong> about this growing <strong><strong>complexity</strong></strong> and how it affects <strong>design</strong> <strong>considerations</strong>:
"There's a <strong>lot</strong> of new <strong>kinds</strong> of <strong><strong>complexity</strong></strong> that you have to think about when producing <strong>some<strong>thing</strong></strong>, even if that <strong>thing</strong> is just a physical <strong>object</strong> with no inherent <strong>functionality</strong> or technology built into it. <strong>Means</strong> of <strong>production</strong> have changed quite a <strong>bit</strong>, so the <strong>options</strong> are much more vast than they used to be, but the scales are very different. You have the <strong>ability</strong> to kind of micro-produce <strong><strong>things</strong></strong>, but also to produce single one-off <strong><strong>things</strong></strong>, so the <strong>designer</strong> in this <strong>case</strong> has to go back to thinking about the <strong>individuals</strong> or small <strong>subsets</strong> of <strong>people</strong> that the product serves. "Then when we get into embedded <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> that actually are <strong>part</strong> of the <strong>network infrastructure</strong>, it's not just about the physical object anymore. The <strong><strong>object</strong></strong> becomes a <strong>container</strong> for <strong><strong>software</strong></strong>, and that <strong><strong>software</strong></strong> can do <strong>things</strong> that are invisible and that <strong>affect</strong> all <strong>sorts</strong> of other <strong>aspects</strong> of the <strong>environment</strong> and [the <strong>user</strong>'s<strong>] relationship</strong> with the <strong><strong>object</strong></strong>s and with the other <strong>people</strong> that that <strong><strong>object</strong></strong> puts them in touch with." How it feels to be inside of a complex <strong>system</strong>
Nish-Lapidus also outlines a <strong>set</strong> of aesthetic <strong>qualities</strong> of <strong>network</strong>ed <strong>system</strong>s for <strong>designers</strong> to use not only as foundational <strong>elements</strong> for designing <strong>objects</strong> within a <strong>network</strong>, but to better <strong>describe</strong> and <strong>understand</strong> the <strong>network</strong> itself. Using "<strong>texture</strong>" as an <strong>example</strong>, he explains:
"This whole <strong>idea</strong> comes from a <strong>tradition</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>design</strong></strong></strong> <strong>foundations</strong>, which has been established for quite a <strong>while</strong> and is much more <strong>commonplace</strong> in industrial <strong><strong><strong>design</strong></strong></strong> and graphic <strong><strong><strong>design</strong></strong></strong> and <strong>architecture</strong>, where there are physical <strong>properties</strong> of <strong>objects</strong> that you have to understand in <strong>order</strong> to be able to make something with them. When we get into designing <strong>software</strong> and networked <strong>things</strong>, where the physical <strong>limitations</strong> are a little different, and the <strong><strong>material</strong></strong> <strong><strong>properties</strong></strong> become much more abstract, we haven't yet done a really great <strong>job</strong> of thinking about the <strong>aesthetics</strong> of those <strong>types</strong> of <strong><strong>material</strong></strong> <strong><strong>properties</strong></strong>, those invisible <strong><strong>properties</strong></strong>. What's interesting about invisible <strong>properties</strong> is that they quickly become visible when you're trying to interact with the <strong>system</strong> at hand. "Taking <strong><strong>texture</strong></strong> as the first one, for <strong>example</strong>, <strong><strong>texture</strong></strong> is looking at the <strong>way</strong> the <strong>system</strong> connects to all of the other <strong>pieces</strong> that <strong>exist</strong> within it, or how those <strong>pieces</strong> interact with each other. When you have a <strong>system</strong> that has multiple <strong>nodes</strong>, and those <strong>nodes</strong> could be human or <strong>inhuman</strong> or physical <strong>objects</strong> or <strong>pieces</strong> of <strong>software</strong>, how does the communication between those happen? ... When you start to talk about that in <strong>terms</strong> of a <strong>texture</strong> of <strong>connection</strong>, you can look at how obvious the <strong>connection</strong>s are. If they're really obvious and easy, and you can access them, and you understand what you're supposed to put in them or what you're going to get out of them, you could talk about that as a 'smooth' form of communication. If it's really confusing, or you get <strong>something</strong> unexpected, or there's <strong>interference</strong> from other <strong>aspects</strong> of the <strong>system</strong>, you could start talking about that as rough or as other <strong>types</strong> of descriptors. This gives us a <strong>kind</strong> of a <strong>fuzzy</strong> aesthetic <strong>language</strong> to start <strong>talking</strong> about how it feels to be inside of a complex system."
