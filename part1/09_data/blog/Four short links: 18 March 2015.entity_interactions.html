How to Make <strong>Moonshots</strong> (Astro Teller) -- <strong>Expecting</strong> a <strong>person</strong> to be a reliable <strong>backup</strong> for the [self-driving car] <strong>system</strong> was a fallacy. Once people trust the system, they trust it. Our success was itself a failure. We came quickly to the <strong>conclusion</strong> that we needed to make it clear to <strong>ourselves</strong> that the human was not a reliable <strong>backup</strong> — the <strong>car</strong> had to always be able to handle the situation. And the best <strong>way</strong> to make that clear was to design a <strong><strong>car</strong></strong> with no <strong>steering wheel</strong> — a <strong><strong>car</strong></strong> that could drive itself all of the <strong>time</strong>, from <strong><strong>point</strong></strong> A to <strong><strong>point</strong></strong> <strong>B</strong>, at the <strong>push</strong> of a button.

"When engineering management is done right, you're focusing on three big things," she says. "You're directly supporting the <strong>people</strong> on your <strong>team</strong>; you're managing <strong>execution</strong> and <strong>coordination</strong> across <strong>team</strong>s; and you're stepping back to observe and evolve the broader <strong>organization</strong> and its processes as it grows." <strong>cxxnet</strong> -- "a fast, <strong>concise</strong>, distributed <strong>deep learning framework</strong>" that scales beyond a single GPU.
