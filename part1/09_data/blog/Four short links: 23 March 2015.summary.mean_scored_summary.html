Swarmfarm Robotics -- His previous weed sprayer weighed 21 tonnes, measured 36 metres across its spray unit, guzzled diesel by the bucketload and needed a paid driver who would only work limited hours. <strong>Two robots working together on Bendee effortlessly sprayed weeds in a 70ha mung-bean crop last month.</strong> Their infra-red beams picked up any small weeds among the crop rows and sent a message to the nozzle to eject a small chemical spray. <strong>Bate hopes to soon use microwave or laser technology to kill the weeds.</strong> Best of all, the robots do the work without guidance. They work 24 hours a day. They have in-built navigation and obstacle detection, making them robust and able to decide if an area of a paddock should not be traversed. Special swarming technology means the robots can detect each other and know which part of the paddock has already been assessed and sprayed.
Route to Market (Matt Webb) -- The route to market is not what makes the product good. [...] So the way you design the product to best take it to market is not the same process to make it great for its users.
<strong>Explorable Explanations -- points to many sweet examples of interactive explorable simulations/explanations.</strong>
I-JSON (Tim Bray) -- I-JSON is just a note saying that if you construct a chunk of JSON and avoid the interop failures described in RFC 7159, you can call it an “I-JSON Message.” If any known JSON implementation creates an I-JSON message and sends it to any other known JSON implementation, the chance of software surprises is vanishingly small.
