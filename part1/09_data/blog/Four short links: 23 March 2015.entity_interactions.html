<strong>Swarmfarm</strong> <strong>Robotics</strong> -- <strong>His</strong> previous <strong>weed sprayer</strong> weighed 21 <strong>tonnes</strong>, measured 36 <strong>metres</strong> across its <strong>spray unit</strong>, guzzled <strong>diesel</strong> by the <strong>bucketload</strong> and needed a paid <strong>driver</strong> who would only work limited hours. Two <strong>robots</strong> working together on <strong>Bendee</strong> effortlessly sprayed <strong>weeds</strong> in a 70ha mung-bean <strong>crop</strong> last month. Their infra-red <strong>beams</strong> picked up any small <strong>weeds</strong> among the <strong>crop</strong> rows and <strong>sent</strong> a <strong>message</strong> to the <strong>nozzle</strong> to eject a small chemical spray. <strong>Bate</strong> hopes to soon use <strong>microwave</strong> or <strong>laser technology</strong> to kill the weeds. Best of all, the <strong>robots</strong> do the <strong>work</strong> without guidance. They work 24 hours a day. They have in-built <strong>navigation</strong> and <strong>obstacle detection</strong>, making them robust and able to decide if an <strong>area</strong> of a paddock should not be traversed. Special <strong>swarming technology</strong> means the <strong>robots</strong> can detect each other and know which <strong>part</strong> of the paddock has already been assessed and sprayed. <strong>Route</strong> to Market (Matt Webb) -- <strong>The</strong> <strong>route</strong> to <strong>market</strong> is not what makes the product good. <strong>[</strong>...] So the <strong>way</strong> you <strong>design</strong> the <strong>product</strong> to best take it to <strong>market</strong> is not the same <strong>process</strong> to make it great for its users. Explorable <strong>Explanations</strong> -- <strong>points</strong> to many sweet <strong>examples</strong> of interactive explorable simulations/explanations. <strong>I-<strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong></strong> (Tim Bray) -- <strong>I-<strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong></strong> is just a <strong>note</strong> saying that if you construct a <strong>chunk</strong> of <strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong> and avoid the <strong>interop</strong> <strong>failures</strong> described in <strong>RFC</strong> 7159, you can call it an “<strong>I-<strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong></strong> <strong>Message.”</strong> If any <strong>known</strong> <strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>implementation</strong></strong> creates an <strong>I-<strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong></strong> message and <strong>sends</strong> it to any other <strong>known</strong> <strong><strong><strong>JSON</strong></strong></strong> <strong><strong>implementation</strong></strong>, the <strong>chance</strong> of <strong>software</strong> surprises is vanishingly small.
